# Project [Karnaugh-Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map)

By @Marloows

Creates a 2-D Array, which represents a mapping of $N$ binary inputs to $1$ binary output.

This visual representation is then used to minimize the number of the logic-gates needed to create the output.

My original idea was to write an algorithm for [TI Voyage 200](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_200). The source code for that is also included. I hope that it still works.

## Disclaimer!!

#IN-THEORY This program can map **any number of inputs** but beware! Memory usage will grow exponentially.
